Final Project for Summer 2019 GD50 Class

## Added Features
###Choose Characters
If the user presses C in the opening screen, he/she can choose from the default male player but also a female, baby, or skeleton.
###Random Experience Adding Flowers
The tall grass now includes randomly scattered flowers that add to the player's experience points. The player will level up if the additional exp crosses the threshold. The flowers are removed after being consumed.
###Healing Flowers in the Grass
The player can no longer heal itself anywhere the grassy field. Now the player needs to have healing flowers to heal. Randomly scattered healing flowers are scattered throughout the grass. The flowers are removed after being consumed.
###Uncertainty in Fleeing
The player can no longer automatically flee a flight. Now there is some uncertainty. If the player's level is less than the opponent's level, the player cannot flee (and will probably result in death). The more levels that the player is above the opponent, the more chance that the player can successfully flee.
###Player Stat Box
The user can now see the player's stats by pressing 'S' anywhere on the board.
